Launch sequence

Generally you should use the standard launch sequence described in Taking Off:

    Poll on Vehicle.is_armable until the vehicle is ready to arm.
    Set the Vehicle.mode to GUIDED
    Set Vehicle.armed to True and poll on the same attribute until the vehicle is armed.
    Call Vehicle.simple_takeoff with a target altitude.
    Poll on the altitude and allow the code to continue only when it is reached.
